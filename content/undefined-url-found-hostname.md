One of our applications will read a query parameter such as `?next=<some url>` and redirect to that once it's done with it's task. In that app, we wanted to verify if the `next` URL provided was either one of our allowed redirect domains, or just a relative path. Otherwise, if it's a URL we don't recognize, don't go there. 

To do this we wanted to parse out the hostname. We were using this solution, which can be found on StackOverflow within seconds of googling "javascript url get hostname" (as the [accepted answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/736970/11294434)...from _2012 mind you_).

```js
function getHostname(url: string): string {
  const urlParser = document.createElement('a');
  urlParser.href = url;
  return urlParser.hostname;
}
```

We had this in our code for 3 years. It "worked fine". 

We used that helper method in our `redirect` function and went on our way:

```js
function redirect(url) {
  const hostname = getHostname(url);
  const pattern = new RegExp(
    '(^|\\.)' + config.ALLOWED_REDIRECT_DOMAIN + '$','i'
  );
  
  // !hostname implies that it's a relative url
  if (!hostname || pattern.test(hostname)) {
    // Do the redirect
  }  

  // Redirect instead to our fallback URL
}
```

You would think that if you accidentally passed `undefined` to this method, that it would not get a hostname, and would therefore continue on to our fallback redirect. 

But no! Using this `<a>` tag hack doesn't work like you would expect. Here's what happens when you give it an undefined href:
```js
const linkElement = document.createElement('a');
linkElement.href = undefined;
console.log(linkElement.hostname);
// "localhost"
```

Wait, what? How is there even a host name? Let's see what it _thinks_ the href is:
```js
console.log(linkElement.href)
// "http://localhost:8080/undefined"
```

ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è...For some reason, it interpreted `undefined` as a string, and assumed we were passing in a relative URL. 


Long story short, it's better to use the [`URL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/URL) method instead. The second most popular, [much more modern answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24006120/11294434) to that original StackOverflow is the way to go. 

Now our code reads:
```js
function redirect(url) {
    // Wrap in a try because URL will throw an error
    // if you pass it an invalid URL
    try {
        const validURL = new URL(url);
        const hostname = validURL.hostname;
        const hostnameRegex = new RegExp(
            `${config.ALLOWED_REDIRECT_DOMAIN}$`
        );
        if (hostnameRegex.test(hostname)) {
            // Do the redirect
        }
    } catch {
        // Use our fallback redirect
    }
}
```

If you're creating a random document element in the middle of your JavaScript just to parse a URL...you're probably doing it wrong.
